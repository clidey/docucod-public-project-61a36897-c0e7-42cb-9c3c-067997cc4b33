# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Welcome to the starting point for successfully implementing **otelsql**, your OpenTelemetry instrumentation library for Go's `database/sql` package. This guide lays out the essential environment details, dependencies, and system recommendations to ensure a smooth installation and flawless operation.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

otelsql is designed to work seamlessly across popular OS platforms where Go is supported:

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and other major distributions)
- **macOS** (10.15 Catalina and later)
- **Windows** (Windows 10/11, with WSL for enhanced Linux compatibility)

> Ensure your OS is up to date with the latest patches to avoid compatibility issues.

## 2. Go Language Version Compatibility

otelsql requires a modern Go environment for optimal performance:

- Minimum Go version: **1.20**
- Recommended Go version: **1.24 or later**

Run the following to verify your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If you have an older version, upgrade via your OS package manager or from the official [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).

## 3. Database Environments Supported

otelsql works with Go's `database/sql` package, thus supporting any SQL databases compatible with it. The most common tested environments include:

- **MySQL (8.0 and later)**
- **PostgreSQL (13 and later)**
- **SQLite3**

> Compatibility relies on the respective database/sql drivers installed and correctly configured.

## 4. Dependencies & Tools

Before installing otelsql, ensure the following are in place:

- **Go modules enabled:** otelsql uses Go modules for dependency management. Confirm by running:

```bash
go env GO111MODULE
```
It should return `on` or `auto`.

- **OpenTelemetry Collector (optional but recommended):** To visualize trace and metric data, setting up an OpenTelemetry Collector with exporters like Jaeger and Prometheus is advised.

- **Docker and Docker Compose (for local examples and testing):** These container tools facilitate spinning up databases and telemetry backends quickly.

## 5. System Specifications

For a smooth experience, particularly when running examples or local tests, the following system specs are recommended:

- **CPU:** 2+ cores
- **Memory:** Minimum 4 GB RAM
- **Disk Space:** At least 1 GB free

These ensure reliable performance during instrumentation and telemetry data processing.

## 6. Network & Firewall Settings

If you plan to forward telemetry data to external collectors or monitoring tools, open the necessary ports:

- **4317** — OTLP gRPC receiver
- **16686** — Jaeger UI
- **9090** — Prometheus server

Adjust firewall rules accordingly on your development or production environment to allow outbound and inbound traffic on these ports.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">
If `go version` returns an older version:

- Upgrade Go to at least 1.20.
- Remove any conflicting old Go installations.
- Rebuild your Go environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Driver Compatibility Issues">

- Make sure you have installed the database driver packages matching your SQL database.
- Check your project’s `go.mod` for package conflicts.
- Test `database/sql` connectivity standalone before adding otelsql.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Port Conflicts or Firewall Blocking">

- Verify no other processes are using the telemetry ports.
- Use commands like `netstat -tuln` or `ss -tuln` to check.
- Temporarily disable firewall or add rules for necessary ports.

</Accordion>

### Callouts

<Tip>
Ensure your Go environment is clean and up to date to avoid build or runtime errors when installing otelsql.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Running telemetry services like Jaeger or Prometheus requires open ports. Restrictive firewall settings will prevent successful data collection.
</Warning>

<Info>
Docker Compose is the easiest way to launch a full telemetry stack locally for testing otelsql instrumentation.
</Info>
