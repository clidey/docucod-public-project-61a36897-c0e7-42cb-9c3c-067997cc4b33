## Recent Feature Highlights

### Version v0.12.0 - Released 2024-05-10

- **Expanded Semantic Conventions Support**
  - Aligned otelsql with the latest OpenTelemetry Stable Semantic Conventions for database attributes.
  - Benefit: Improved interoperability and standardized tracing data across telemetry systems.
  - See [Semantic Conventions and Stability Levels](/api-reference/advanced-reference/semantic-conventions) for detailed usage.

- **Enhanced Metrics Instrumentation with `RegisterDBStatsMetrics`**
  - Added new metrics tracking connection pool wait times and errors.
  - Benefit: Gain deeper insights into connection behavior affecting latency and throughput.
  - Example usage provided in [Instrumenting Metrics with RegisterDBStatsMetrics](/api-reference/core-api/metrics-instrumentation).

- **Improved Integration Example with OpenTelemetry Collector**
  - Updated Docker Compose configurations to support latest Prometheus and Jaeger versions.
  - Benefit: Easier testing and visualization of traces and metrics.
  - Check [Sending Telemetry to the OpenTelemetry Collector](/guides/advanced-scenarios/otel-collector-integration) for setup details.

### Version v0.11.0 - Released 2024-02-28

- **New API Method: `WrapDriver` for flexible instrumentation**
  - Enables wrap-on-top approach to instrument any registered `database/sql` driver without changing existing connection code.
  - Benefit: Simplifies adding telemetry without refactoring database initialization.
  - Learn implementation patterns in [Recommended Instrumentation Patterns](/guides/best-practices/instrumentation-patterns).

- **Context Propagation Enhancements Using SQLCommenter**
  - Added support for attaching custom context propagation info to SQL queries using SQLCommenter.
  - Benefit: Achieve richer trace correlation between application code and database operations.
  - Details and examples are in [SQLCommenter: Context Propagation & Enhanced Tracing](/guides/advanced-scenarios/sqlcommenter-context-propagation).

- **Performance Optimizations for High-Throughput Scenarios**
  - Reduced overhead for frequently executed queries by optimizing span creation and metrics collection.
  - Benefit: Maintain minimal latency impact during heavy database access.
  - Review performance tuning tips in [Optimizing Metrics & Performance Impact](/guides/best-practices/metrics-tuning).

### Version v0.10.0 - Released 2023-11-15

- **Initial Stable Release with Core Instrumentation Features**
  - Established the foundational instrumentation APIs: `Open`, `OpenDB`, `Register`, and baseline metrics.
  - Benefit: Enable standardized OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics on Go’s `database/sql` with minimal code changes.
  - Start instrumenting using the quickstart guide: [Instrumenting database/sql with otelsql](/guides/getting-started/quickstart-instrumentation).

- **Introductory Metrics Collection for `sql.DBStats`**
  - Basic visibility into open connections, idle connections, and wait counts.
  - Benefit: Easily monitor connection pool health and potential bottlenecks.

- **Example Projects for Collector and Visualization**
  - Delivered sample projects including MySQL client instrumentation and integrated OTEL Collector with Prometheus and Jaeger.
  - Benefit: Hands-on reference to validate your instrumentation setup.
  - Explore the example setup at [Run Local Examples (Docker & Compose)](/getting-started/examples-integration/local-quickstart-examples).

## Practical Tips to Leverage New Features

- When upgrading between major versions, review any breaking changes thoroughly in [Breaking Changes & Migration Steps](/changelog/upgrade-migration/breaking-changes).
- Register your database stats metrics early with `RegisterDBStatsMetrics` to unlock rich metrics for dashboards and alerts.
- Use the SQLCommenter integration to enhance trace context propagation for complex distributed transactions.

---

## Troubleshooting and Validation

If you notice missing traces or metrics after an upgrade or new feature integration:
- Verify that your instrumentation calls match the updated API usage.
- Confirm your telemetry pipeline setup with OpenTelemetry Collector and visualization tools like Jaeger or Prometheus.
- Consult [Troubleshooting: Missing Spans or Metrics](/guides/advanced-scenarios/troubleshooting-signals) for targeted diagnostics.
