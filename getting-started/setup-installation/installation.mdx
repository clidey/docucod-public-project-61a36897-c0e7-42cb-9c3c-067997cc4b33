# Installing otelsql

This guide walks you through the exact steps to install the **otelsql** instrumentation library for Go, ensuring it is correctly added as a dependency in your project and ready for use. Whether you're starting a new Go project or integrating into an existing one, this page covers package management commands, common environment hints, and verification methods.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing otelsql, make sure you have the following:

- **Go environment** installed and configured properly (Go 1.16+ is recommended).
- Your project is using Go Modules (`go.mod` present) for dependency management.
- Network access to fetch packages from `proxy.golang.org` or your module proxy.

> If you’re new to Go modules, ensure your project directory contains a `go.mod` file by running:
>
> ```bash
> go mod init your-module-name
> ```

---

## 2. Adding otelsql as a Dependency

To include otelsql in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```bash
go get github.com/XSAM/otelsql@latest
```

This pulls the latest mainline version of otelsql into your module dependencies.

> **Tip:** Pinning a specific version or tag is best practice for production stability. For example:
>
> ```bash
> go get github.com/XSAM/otelsql@v0.9.0
> ```


After fetching, verify that your `go.mod` has been updated to include the module:

```bash
cat go.mod | grep otelsql
```

You should see an entry similar to:

```
require github.com/XSAM/otelsql v0.9.0 // indirect
```

## 3. Considerations for Common Development Environments

### IDEs and Editors
- Ensure your IDE (VSCode, GoLand, etc.) refreshes module dependencies after running `go get`.
- Some IDEs have Go modules integration that automatically runs `go mod tidy`.

### Proxy and Caching
- If your network uses a private proxy or needs credentials, configure `GOPROXY` environment variable accordingly.
- Example to disable proxy (not recommended unless necessary):

```bash
export GOPROXY=direct
```

### Working with Vendor Folders
- If using vendoring (`go mod vendor`), run this command post-install:

```bash
go mod vendor
```

- This ensures otelsql and its dependencies are copied locally.

---

## 4. Verifying the Installation

To confirm that otelsql installed successfully:

1. Run:

```bash
go list -m all | grep github.com/XSAM/otelsql
```

You should see your otelsql dependency listed.

2. Alternatively, try to import otelsql in a Go file:

```go
package main

import "github.com/XSAM/otelsql"

func main() {}
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
go build
```

No errors related to missing packages indicate success.

> **Common Issue:** 
> If you see "module not found" errors, double-check your internet connection and proxy settings.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Network or Proxy Errors
- Check your `GOPROXY` and `GONOPROXY` environment variables:

```bash
go env GOPROXY
```

- Set GOPROXY to `https://proxy.golang.org,direct` to allow fallback.

### Module Version Conflicts
- Run `go mod tidy` to clean up inconsistencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

- Check if your project or dependencies require conflicting versions of otelsql and resolve manually.

### IDE Doesn’t Recognize New Dependency
- Restart the IDE to refresh module cache.
- Run `go clean -modcache` to clear cache if necessary.

### Building Fails After Installation
- Confirm your Go version supports module mode:

```bash
go version
```

- Ensure your `go.mod` file exists and is valid.

## 6. Next Steps

With otelsql successfully installed, proceed to:

- [Configuration Basics](/getting-started/configuration-usage/basic-configuration) to set up your instrumentation.
- [First otelsql Integration](/getting-started/configuration-usage/first-otel-instrumentation) for detailed examples on adding tracing to your database/sql usage.
- Explore [Local Examples](/getting-started/examples-integration/local-quickstart-examples) to see otelsql in action with OpenTelemetry Collector.
