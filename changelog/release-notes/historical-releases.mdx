# All Releases & Change History

A comprehensive and structured index of all otelsql releases, providing detailed summaries of new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other significant updates. This page serves as the definitive reference for tracking otelsql evolution, assisting users in understanding version changes, planning upgrades, and ensuring compatibility.

---

## Purpose and Scope

This changelog documents the version history of the otelsql library, with a focus exclusively on released versions and their respective changes. Users can leverage this record to:

- Quickly identify what new capabilities or fixes each version introduces.
- Understand any breaking changes that may require migration steps.
- Track deprecations or removals affecting their integrations.
- Reference security fixes and stability enhancements.

The information here is presented from the user perspective, emphasizing the impact on the usage and integration of otelsql rather than internal implementation details.

---

## Versioning Strategy

otelsql follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) principles:

- Versions are formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Increment `MAJOR` for incompatible API changes.
- Increment `MINOR` for backward-compatible functionality additions.
- Increment `PATCH` for backward-compatible bug fixes.

This clear strategy helps users anticipate the stability and scope of changes when upgrading.
